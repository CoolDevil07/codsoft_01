## Introduction

Chatbots are computer programs that can simulate conversation with human users. This project demonstrates the creation of a simple chatbot in Python that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. It serves as a basic introduction to natural language processing and the fundamentals of building conversational AI.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python (3.6 or higher) installed on your system.

   The chatbot will start, and you can interact with it by typing messages.

## Usage

- The chatbot will continuously prompt the user for input until you type "exit" to quit the conversation.
- You can enter various queries or statements, and the chatbot will respond based on predefined rules.
- Sample predefined rules and responses are provided in the script, but you can customize them as needed.

## Customization

You can customize the chatbot in several ways:

- Modify the predefined rules and responses in the `simple_chatbot` function in the `chatbot.py` script to make the chatbot respond to different queries or statements.
- Enhance the chatbot's capabilities by integrating more advanced natural language processing techniques, such as sentiment analysis or machine learning models.
- Extend the chatbot to interact with external databases or APIs to provide more dynamic responses.
